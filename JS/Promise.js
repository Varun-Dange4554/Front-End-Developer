/*
In JavaScript, a Promise is an object that represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.
 It acts as a placeholder for a value that may not yet be available, allowing you to handle the results of asynchronous operations in a more structured and predictable way than traditional callbacks. 
A Promise can exist in one of three states:
Pending: The initial state; the asynchronous operation has not yet completed.
Fulfilled (Resolved): The operation completed successfully, and the promise now holds a resulting value.
Rejected: The operation failed, and the promise holds a reason for the failure (an error object).

//? promise took callBack Function and also took (resolve,reject);

// $    ()=>{} // callback function

  let got_ice_cream = false;
  if (got_ice_cream) res(got_ice_cream);
  else rej(got_ice_cream);

// console.log('ðŸš€ ~ ice_cream:', ice_cream);
